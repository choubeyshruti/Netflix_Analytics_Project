# Netflix_Analytics_Project
based on netflix

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Access

This project uses datasets from Kaggleâ€™s [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) and [TMDB Movie Credits](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).

Due to GitHubâ€™s file size limitations, **large datasets like `credits.csv` are not stored in this repository**.  
Instead, follow these steps to get the data locally:

1. **Download datasets** from the following links:
   - ðŸ“„ Netflix titles: [netflix_titles.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)
   - ðŸ“„ TMDB Credits: [credits.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)

2. **Place them in the correct folder**:
/data/raw/netflix_titles.csv
/data/raw/credits.csv


3. **Optional:** Use the sample datasets in `/data/sample/` to run the project without downloading full datasets.  
These contain the first 1,000 rows from each file for quick testing.

> âš  You will need a free Kaggle account to download the datasets.

**Why not upload the full CSV here?**  
GitHub has a 25 MB per-file upload limit and a 50 MB push limit.  
To keep the repository lightweight and fast to clone, we store only **sample data** in the repo and link to the original sources.
